        <p>
          Verse By Verse Fellowship (VBVF) is the result of a church planting
          effort by Verse By Verse Ministry International (VBVMI), a
          non-denominational, Bible teaching ministry headquartered in San
          Antonio, Texas, featuring the in-depth Bible teaching of Pastor
          Stephen Armstrong, founder of VBVM. The ministry is committed to
          providing compelling, verse-by-verse teaching of God’s word at no
          charge (2Cor 2:17), thus ensuring the whole counsel of God is
          proclaimed (Acts 20:27)
        </p>

          For nearly 15 years Steve taught the Bible verse-by-verse with unique
          insight and clarity to congregations in and around San Antonio and to
          churches around the world as part of his itinerant teaching ministry.
          During this time Steve also pastored a church in Austin, Texas, for
          over a decade while teaching for VBVMI.

          In Fall 2017, the VBVMI Board of Directors saw an opportunity to
          expand the reach of VBVMI by establishing a single, local platform for
          Steve’s teaching, while also meeting a need in San Antonio for a
          pulpit ministry dedicated to the proper exposition of Scripture.
          Consequently, the Board voted to plant a church in the San Antonio,
          and in January 2018 VBVF began weekly services by meeting on Thursday
          nights at Grace Bible Chapel. In only a few months the VBVF
          congregation has grown to nearly 200 worshipping on Saturday nights at
          Oak Hills Church North Central campus.
        </p>

          Our vision at VBVF is to reassert the importance and necessity of the
          public proclamation of God’s word through expository Bible teaching
          from the pulpit. We believe that when the Bible is taught methodically
          and properly, good things happen: lives are changed, relationships are
          restored, marriages are strengthened, addictions are cured, ministries
          begin and souls are saved. Therefore, we do not depend (solely) on
          small group Bible studies to develop the spiritual maturity of our
          people. Rather, we use every moment in our corporate gathering to grow
          in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Christ followers, we are commanded by scripture to be lifelong
          students of God’s Word and walk in community with each other. Come
          share in that mission at Verse By Verse Fellowship.
