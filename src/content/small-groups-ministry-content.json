  "ministrySummary": "We feel that small groups are an important avenue for spiritual growth. Our small groups are made up of people who call VBVF their home church. There are 7 small groups that meet around the city of San Antonio. Each of them is unique, but all of them seek to promote spiritual growth in our church body. We do that through discussion of the sermon concepts, prayer and fellowship. At Verse By Verse Fellowship, we value community and believe that the best way to experience authentic relationships is in a smaller group setting. We believe the Scriptures teach that the church is not a building or location, but people of God on a mission. We also believe that things like acceptance, accountability, love, care, vulnerability, commitment, authentic friendships, prayer, learning, support, and growth begin in the context of our Small Groups. This is how we nurture and grow people in Christ.",

      "question": "Why should i be a part of a small group?",
      "answer": "As a Christian, you can only grow so far on your own, which is why small groups are so important. Through small groups, we grow in our relationship with God and walk out our Christian lifestyle together as a family. Being a part of a small group will help you deepen your relationship with God and help you to become more spiritually mature. Through a small group, you will also develop long-lasting friendships that will encourage you, strengthen you, and help you walk out your faith."

      "question": "What happens during a small group gathering?",
      "answer": "All small groups follow an outline based on the sermon of the week, but the goal is to deepen your relationship with God, with others in that group and reach people within your community who are far from God.Generally speaking, a small group will have a time of prayer, a discussion centered around the sermon of the week, a time for intimate discussion, and a time for prayer requests"
