  "ministrySummary": "We feel that small groups are an important avenue for spiritual growth. Our small groups are made up of people who call VBVF their home church. There are 7 small groups that meet around the city of San Antonio. Each of them is unique, but all of them seek to promote spiritual growth in our church body. We do that through discussion of the sermon concepts, prayer and fellowship.",

    "bio": "In addition to serving as the Small Groups Director, Shane serves as an urban missionary on the east side of San Antonio. He is passionate about helping Christians connect to life-giving ministry in the community in which they reside. Shane believes that Small Groups create an environment whereby we can experience Christ while living life with others. Small Groups create a natural environment for people to express Christ's love to one another. And when hearts adore Christ, people are compelled to express His love to those who have not yet experienced it in the world around us."
