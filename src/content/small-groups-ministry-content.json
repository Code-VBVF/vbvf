  "ministrySummary": "We feel that small groups are an important avenue for spiritual growth. Our small groups are made up of people who call VBVF their home church. There are 8 small groups that meet around the city of San Antonio. Each of them is unique, but all of them seek to promote spiritual growth in our church body. We do that through discussion of the sermon concepts, prayer and fellowship.",
