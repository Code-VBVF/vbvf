        <p>
          In early June, we selected a tentative reopening date of June 13th and
          14th, but after a sudden increase in COVID-19 cases in Bexar County,
          we have postponed the restart of weekly services until at least July
          11, 2020. We hope to provide another update by early July. Obviously,
          we are disappointed by an additional delay, but we believe waiting
          until cases of COVID-19 diminish further is in the best interests of
          our church body and the city of San Antonio. Meanwhile, we encourage
          you to continue worshiping with us remotely by taking part in the
          weekly livestreams of both our weekend worship service on Sundays at
          10:30 AM and our midweek Bible study in Ephesians on Tuesday nights at
          7:00 PM. Please visit this page anytime for the latest information on
          our reopening plans.
